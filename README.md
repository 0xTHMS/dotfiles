dotfiles
========

A collection of my personal dotfiles. Nothing fancy, no overkill dotfiles framework in use.

Installation
------------
To use these dotfiles simply clone this repo and run the setup script:

    $ ./setup.sh

The setup script will make sure to backup any pre-existing dotfiles in your home directory (~/.dotfiles_backup) before overwriting them.
